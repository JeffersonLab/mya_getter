# mya_getter

A python wrapper package on MYA utilities.

## Overview 
A light wrapper on common MYA utilities used at CEBAF.  These wrapped utilities are currently command line executables,
however, this software offers easy parallelization through the use of process pools.

Currently supported utilities are mySampler and myData.  These applications must be installed on your local system for
this package to be of much use.
